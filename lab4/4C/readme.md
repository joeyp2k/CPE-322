## Ngrok

## Memory Game

## Alexa Running
There was an issue where entering memory game into the Alexa simulator would result in Alexa responding with "The requested skill did not provide a valid response".  The Ngrok script would receive the HTTP requests as shown in the console, however, I was unable to fix this error.
